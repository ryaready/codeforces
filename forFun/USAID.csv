This partnership is a global partnership of developing and donor countries and agencies, civil society organizations, private foundations and the private sector. GPE focuses on accelerating progress towards the 'Education for All' goals. GPE's areas of focus are: 1) increasing equitable access to education in the primary grades, 2) creating improvements in learning outcomes, especially with regard to literacy and numeracy; 3) making education accessible in fragile and conflict-affected environments; 4) focusing on marginalized children while building sustainable, quality education systems. These priorities complement USAID's Education Strategy. USAID's contribution to the GPE Fund will advance USAID's goals set forth in E3/Education's 'Education Strategy' and will provide substantial leverage of USIAD's current resources.

The GHSC was designed to provide supply chain technical assistance as well as commodity procurement for the Bureau of Global Health, regardless of the commodity type. As the primary diagnostic tool for determining HIV/AIDS status and the gateway for care and treatment of HIV positive people, RTKs play a vital role in combatting the global HIV/AIDS epidemic. Without an adequate and timely supply of quality RTKs, HIV/AIDS programs cannot function. Thus Remote Medical International (RMI) will play a vital role in supporting the USGs goal of achieving an AIDS-free generation in our lifetime. The primary objective of this Contract is to ensure the availability of approved HIV Rapid Test Kits (RTKs) using a global procurement strategy. An RTK is defined as an assay for the diagnosis of infection with HIV-1/2 or type specific diagnosis of HIV-1 and HIV-2, from which test results can be read directly, within 30 minutes of the time the specimen is applied to the device, without calibration or calculations. The USAID Global Health Supply Chain - Rapid Test Kits (GHSC- RTKs) project will have the responsibility for the procurement and shipment of HIV rapid test kits (RTKs) to designated destinations and stakeholders for use in host country HIV and AIDS programs. Other procurement and supply chain-related services will be provided by other contracts within the GHSC Program.

CELI-C also carries out activities in the cross-cutting areas of: a) environmental awareness and sensitivity, b) gender equity, and c) communications to support a culture of legality and good citizenship.In its third year of operation, CELI-C plans to focus its strategy and project activities using FY 14 funds to generate more sustainable livelihoods and support rural economic development. This focus is transitioning from CELI-C's initial focus of sponsoring quick-response activities that demonstrated the effective presence of the Colombian State in remote areas of the country. Under this new focus the following types of activities will be prioritized: 1) those that directly impact income generation in target areas; 2) support for the integration of production and commercialization in value chains in important economic sectors; 3) infrastructure improvements focused on facilitating local economic development, and 4) encouraging inclusive entrepreneurship.

The GHSC was designed to provide supply chain technical assistance as well as commodity procurement for the Bureau of Global Health, regardless of the commodity type. As the primary diagnostic tool for determining HIV/AIDS status and the gateway for care and treatment of HIV positive people, RTKs play a vital role in combatting the global HIV/AIDS epidemic. Without an adequate and timely supply of quality RTKs, HIV/AIDS programs cannot function. Thus Remote Medical International (RMI) will play a vital role in supporting the USGs goal of achieving an AIDS-free generation in our lifetime. The primary objective of this Contract is to ensure the availability of approved HIV Rapid Test Kits (RTKs) using a global procurement strategy. An RTK is defined as an assay for the diagnosis of infection with HIV-1/2 or type specific diagnosis of HIV-1 and HIV-2, from which test results can be read directly, within 30 minutes of the time the specimen is applied to the device, without calibration or calculations. The USAID Global Health Supply Chain - Rapid Test Kits (GHSC- RTKs) project will have the responsibility for the procurement and shipment of HIV rapid test kits (RTKs) to designated destinations and stakeholders for use in host country HIV and AIDS programs. Other procurement and supply chain-related services will be provided by other contracts within the GHSC Program.
